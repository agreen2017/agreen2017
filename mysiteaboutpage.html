    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>As women, we spend a lot of time, money, and energy making sure we present our best selves to 
      the world...that includes making sure our hair looks great! Why spend hours in the hair salon only to walk past cigarette smoke or other foul outside odors, and suffer all day because every time you turn your head or get close to someone, you both get a whiff of that odor? Every time you hug someone, whether you like it or not,they smell your hair. When you don't have time to wash it or can't afford a salon visit,you now have a way to make sure your hair smells great, no matter what!
    </p>

    <p>I have always been obsessed with hair care. As a co-founder of a popular online hair care board years ago, 
      I learned that women all over the world, value hair products that give them choices and styling options, without risking the health of their hair. One day, I left the hair salon and went directly to meet a friend for dinner. As I gave them a hug, she  exclaimed, "Oh, your hair smells great!". I thought,"Ok, I'm wearing deodorant, perfume and my breath is minty fresh (lol), but what stands out to them the most, to the point that they're excited, is that my hair smells great?". Since, I'm a fragrance fanatic, that was a lightbulb moment for me. I began my quest to find a product that would keep my hair smelling great between salon visits, but I was not willing to compromise the health of my hair. I could not find anything that wasn't damaging, alcohol-laden and that would give me fragrance options I was used to in other products (body sprays, deodorant, etc.) On top of that, I wanted something that would not alter my hair style no matter how I chose to wear my hair or force me to change my hair product regimen, in any way. After much trial and error and using myself and my friends as guinea pigs (to test on a variety of ethnicities)...Temptra Hair Perfume was born! I wore my hair relaxed when I was creating it and am now natural, so I know from experience, that it works on both hair types. As far as the body spray feature...I discovered it by  accident! I was on my way to work and was in panic mode because I forgot to put on perfume (I'm a fragrance junkie, remember?). After rummaging through my purse for a solution, I pulled out my bottle and was like..."Hmmm...". It worked perfectly!

      I hope you enjoy this product as much as my friends and I, do. It is still made by hand and with love...I want nothing but the best for my customers and would not offer anyone something that I wouldn't use,myself
